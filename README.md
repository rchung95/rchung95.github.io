# Personal Website V3
I decided to change the design of my personal website again only after 5 months of the old design. I kind of gotten sick of my design, started looking at new design trends.

## What's New in V3?
I strongly believe simple is better. While looking at other developer's personal webpage, I got inspired by a few of them, where their websites were kept clean and simple. The websites I saw was straight to the point, with links to their LinkedIn, Github, and social media linked.

#### What I built it with?
I build it with just plain old HTML5 and CSS3. I also used Bootstrap 4 as my framework to make the webpage responsive.
