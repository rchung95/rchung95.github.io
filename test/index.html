			<h1>Facebook Group Chat Tagging</h1>
			<img src="./facebook.png" alt="Feature UI">
			<p><i>If you would like to view the animated version, click <a href="./FacebookNotification.gif">here</a></i></p>
			<p>I am in a few group chats with my friends on Facebook. In one of my groups, we would often have very stimulating conversation that last over 30 minutes. Often whenever I am doing work, I would get lots of notification of what my friends wrote. It got to the point that I decided to permanently mute the chat in order to ignore the notifications, because the constant vibrating notifications drove me nuts and distracts me from doing any work. Occasionally, I would check the chat on my phone to see what the conversation was about, and would scroll up to see my name mentioned asking me about something. Even though I muted the chat, I wished I could be notified if someone within the group mentions me in their message.</p><p>By being able to tag friends in chats, it makes it easier for users who muted their chat to be notify of any matter they are mentioned in. When the messenger app is opened, the mentioned user can just click the floating bubble be redirected to where they were tag in. This makes it easier for users to find and read relevant messages.</p>
			
			<p>Feel free to connect with me, I love meeting people!</p>
